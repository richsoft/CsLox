# CsLox - A C# Lox Interpreter

A C# implementation of the Lox language interpreter from the [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com) ebook by [Bob Nystrom](https://github.com/munificent).

This is basically a direct port of **jlox** from the book.



### Language Extensions

* `break` and `continue` in loops
* `do` .. `while` loops
* Number to string coercion on concatination (`+`)
